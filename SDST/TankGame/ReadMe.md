# TankGame

## Known Issues
- I use map chunks but lighting is still wrong since all the chunk model matrices are still at the center of the map.

## Controls
- WASD for movement
- Q,E to roll
- Mouse to shoot and look around
- F4 for wireframe and debug lighting shaders
- Z,X,C,V for debug render demos
